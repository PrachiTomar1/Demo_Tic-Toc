# Note Points:
1. Game Setup: A 3x3 board is represented by a list of 9 spaces.
2. Player Input: Two players ("X" and "O") take turns to enter a position (1-9) corresponding to the boardâ€™s spots.
3. Game Logic:
   a. After every move, the board is updated and displayed.
   b. The program checks if the current player has won by forming a line of three on the board.
   c. If all spots are filled and no player has won, it results in a tie.
4. Game End: The game announces a winner or a tie and then stops.
